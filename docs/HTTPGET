+ HTTPGET +
Sends an HTTP GET request to a website.
Action type: Yielding
Usage: HTTPGET <URL>

This action pauses the script until the request is complete. Upon completion, three variables will be created:
- {HTTPSUCCESS} - True or false, depending on if the website returned HTTP Code 200.
- {HTTPCODE} - The status code response.
- {HTTPRESULT} - The body of information returned from the website.

These variables are created as per-script variables, meaning they can only be used in the script that created them. If these variables already exist (such as a prior HTTPGET/HTTPPOST execution), they will be overwritten with new values.


Arguments:
<url>
  Required: YES
  Type: String (Message/Text)
  The URL to send a GET request to.

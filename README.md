Some conventions i made up :
Local variable : `nameOfTheFile_nameOfTheVariable`

Name of the Folders
The folders of the Global Events start with `GE_`
After if it's a "small Global Events" add a `O_`
Then the name of the Global Events with the first letter as a capital
Examples : 
- `GE_NameOfALongEvent`
- `GE_O_NameOfASmallEvent`

The name of the startup file of the GE should only have the name of the folder BUT with the initials of the name of the Global Event
Examples: 
- `GE_NOALE`
- `GE_NOASE`

The name of the file inside this folder should be :
the name of the folder, BUT with the initials of the name of the Global Event
And what it's doing
Examples with the GE from before:
- `GE_NOALE_NameOfAFile`
- `GE_O_NOASE_NameOfAnAnotherFile`
